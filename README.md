# Parser for SER data

This repository contains a parser for `.ser` files generated by Thermo Fisher
Scientific (formerly FEI) acquisition software.

## Depencies

- _Rust_ dependencies are handled through Cargo
- For the example [RECAST3D](https://www.github.com/cicwi/RECAST3D)
  adapter, we assume a specific naming scheme. For this the =tomopackets= Python
  library should be installed.

## Installing (manual)

The parser is written in Rust, and may use features from the _nightly_ toolchain.

1. Follow the instruction for installing Rust https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html
2. Enable nightly channel using `rustup install nightly`.
3. Clone and build/run the example
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/jwbuurlage/ser-parser
cd ser-parser
cargo build
cargo run
```
4. Build and install the Python library
```bash
cargo install maturin
maturin build
conda activate somecondaenvironment
pip install target/wheels/the_right_wheel.whl
```
5. Use from Python;
```python
import ser_parser

shape, data = ser_parser.parser("ser_file")

print(shape, data)
```
